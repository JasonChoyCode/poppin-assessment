# Take Home Webpage Poppin

## Run Locally
```bash
   cd poppin-app
   npm install
   npm run dev
```

## Implementation Thoughts
- Would have liked to have created and added my own visual elements, such as hovered confetti like the poppin website
- Created a very simple search query for local testing with useState only. On a bigger scale, we would have used a different approach.
- A search was done to filter down to any keywords that corresponded to what the user input.
- Underglow was employed to add animations for the user once they hovered over certain buttons. Adds elements of interactiveness.
- Tried to make the card minimalistic to not be too overcrowded, but still aesthetically pleasing.
